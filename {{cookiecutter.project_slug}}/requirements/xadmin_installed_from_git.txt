# `xadmin` needs to be installed from the github repository.
# However, running `pip freeze > requirements/base.txt` doesn't
# specify the git repository for `xadmin`. Therefore, you need
# to manually add it by choosing one of the following (and removing
# xadmin==x.x.xx):

# source
# git+git://github.com/sshwsfc/xadmin.git

# @engineervix's fork (no changes from original, as of 2017-12-25)
